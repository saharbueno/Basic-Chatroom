## Description

This site is a basic chatroom where you can set your own username and password, login, and chat to everyone else in the room! This website was created using a blend of HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL.

## Takeaways

My main accomplishment with this project was learning how to use APIs in JavaScript to constantly grab the chat data to refresh the chatroom whenever there is a new message. One thing I want to work on is the UI/UX design since I left it completely unstyled to focus on getting the API to work.
